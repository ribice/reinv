# DO NOT RUN

Do not run this project unless you know what you are doing.

The startup scripts have been disabled in package.json to prevent accidental execution. They are prefixed by word 'DISABLED' in the scripts section.

The secrets were obfuscated in the .env file and in code (for Keap). The original code had them in plain text.
